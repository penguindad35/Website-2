                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>A few years ago I got caught up in the super expensive 10 Step skincare routine, I quickly realized it was doing more harm than good and completely destroying my skin barrier. My eyes opened up pretty quickly from there, as some one who had made so many non toxic switches in their home I was shocked I hadn’t looked into my skincare more. We really don’t need to be packing on super expensive products packed with chemicals onto our skin. Nature offers so many amazing ingredients we can use on our skin. I took a deep dive into natural skin care, I’ve loved herbs and essential oils since I was in middle school and have always loved making anything I could on my own, so that’s exactly what I did, I took a few courses on natural skin formulations and paired it with the knowledge I’ve had on herbs and essential oils for years and started creating as much as I could because we all deserve access to skincare with simple non toxic ingredients we can read and pronounce. We should all feel good about what we use on our skin and I’m so happy to be the person to make that happen for so many. </p>
